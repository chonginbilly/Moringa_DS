This lab serves as a hands-on application of our acquired knowledge, emphasizing the strategic use of Python's conditional constructs for precise and selective variable assignments. Through this practical endeavor, we aim to reinforce our proficiency in utilizing conditionals to create tailored and effective programming logic."
